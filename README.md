# 1941 Game

This repository contains the development of the game "1941" by Marcos Galan.

## Description

"1941" is a Python game developed using the Pygame library. The game is inspired by classic arcade-style games where players control a character and navigate through various levels. The game involves managing scenes and handling user inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   cd 1941
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:
